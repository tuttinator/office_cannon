# Office Cannon

This is a project to experiment with the Dream Cheeky USB Office Cannon,
which fires foam projectiles.

Status: Work in Progress (pre-alpha)

Inspired by the tutorial for the [GoPiGo by Dexter
Industries](https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo/blob/master/Software/Python/Examples/Office_Cannon/)

Also [Pat Kua's blog
post](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2012/05/usb-programming-with-ruby/)
was helpful.
